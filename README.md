tramwatch
=========

Tramwatch is a watchapp for pebble watches to show the user the time until the next tram arrives at their selected stop.  It uses httpebble (https://github.com/Katharine/httpebble-watch) to communicate with a server that connects directly to the the official TramTracker PIDS web service (http://ws.tramtracker.com.au/pidsservice/pids.asmx) to provide realtime tram information to the user for their current location or from their list of favourite trams stops.

Please be aware of the Terms and Conditions of using the TramTracker PIDS web service if you plan to use this code for your own project. These can be found here (http://ws.tramtracker.com.au/pidsservice/Terms.aspx)

Onboard tram information will be included if possible at a later date.
